        <h1>Soccer</h1> is a team sport played between
        two teams of <mark>eleven players</mark> on a rectangular field
        with a goal at each end. The game is played with a
        <pre>round ball</pre>
        that players aim to move by kicking, passing, and dribbling.
        Goals are scored by getting the ball into the opposing team's net
        using any part of the body except the hands or arms, except for the
        <code>goalkeeper</code> who can use their hands within the penalty area.
        The <abbr>defending and goalkeeping</abbr> team tries to stop the
        attacking side from scoring and <blockquote>win possession</blockquote>
        of the ball.
